### Unfixed Bugs

- In the CSS file there is a bug regarding the font-family. Which if changed becomes unusable. The bug doesn't seem to affect the launching or design. So I let it stay as is.

## Credits 

- Firstly I want to credit my fellow students for both being there easing the stress, but also coming up with ideas of solutions.
- Second credit Code Institute and the Walkthrough "Love Running" project. I tried hard to not copy any code, but I have used the structure given in teh video of begining from the top and working my way down. I have also copied the basic structure of this README.md file just to give me the headings and a better understanding. 
- To get the footer to stick to bottom of each page I copied the code given by https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/, I have consistenly in text wherever used credited and linked to that webpage in comments to the code.
- To structure the layout of images and also text I've used a combination of a book (HTML&CSS by Jon Duckett), I have gotten help from Student support Tutoring sessions, special acknowledgemnt here to Christine from Code Institute for helping me align the images and text on the index.html page. I have also googled trouble shooting issues. But I haven't copy pasted code. I'm unsure if the credit needs to be more specific then that.
